# social_networks_paper

To check:

* recoding covariates longitudinal.Rmd
	* This should be the same as the one you already checked, I only added the wave 2 SENAS measures (which should also be scaled) and wave 2 age, and also coded retirement status for a covariate.

* mixed models.Rmd
	* This does the cross-sectional analysis
	* This should also be similar to before, I only added retirement status and the imputation using the core covariates

* mixed models longitudinal.Rmd
	* This does the longitudinal analysis

* make_table1.R
	* This just makes table1 that I put in the paper
